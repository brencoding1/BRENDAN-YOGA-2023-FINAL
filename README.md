# Testing

The website is overll a very clean and easily navigatable website. The logo in the top left corner is clickable and is available on all three pages. When clicked, it directs you back to the home page. The Home, Gallery and Sign Up page links all work seemlessly. The social media links at the bottom of the page all work also and open up into a new pab when they are clicked upon. The Sign Up page allows you to enter your first name, surname and email and also to choose what type of yoga you like. These features overall provide an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

The website works well on all browsers and devices. When shrunkin down it adapts perfectly to mobile size and can be used and read just as easily as when it is in desktop mode.

Some bugs I noticed are that the gallery page takes a longer time to load compared to the home page and sign up page. This is most likely due to the amount of images on the page and also due to their size being too large. 

I also found that on the sign up page that although details can be sucsessfully entered, you are not lead to any page after that indicated that your sign up was sucessful or has been completed.


## Validator Testing

* HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

* CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Unfixed Bugs 

As mentioned above, the gallery page loads slower than the main and sign-up pages, which is one of the bugs I found. This is most likely caused by the large number of images and their excessive size on the website. 

In addition, I discovered that even after successfully entering your information on the sign-up website, you are not directed to a page that shows that your sign-up was successful or complete.
